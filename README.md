# ðŸ§  MIPS Assembly Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level **MIPS Assembly Language programs**. These programs are designed to help understand low-level programming concepts, such as data transfer, arithmetic operations, control flow, and system calls using the **MIPS32 instruction set**.

All code is written for execution on the **MARS** (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) or **SPIM** environment.
